You keep talking to Pi the way you always do. Fabric gives the model **one programmable tool** — `fabric_exec` — that it uses to compose Pi's core tools, MCP servers, captured extension tools, child agents, persistent actors, and durable coordination into a single type-checked TypeScript program. The program runs in a QuickJS sandbox by default; an explicit unsafe Node-process executor is available for trusted workloads that exceed WASM32 memory. Only the final result comes back to the conversation. Branching, loops, fan-out, and data flow become code the model writes and type-checks — not a stack of separate tool calls you have to orchestrate.

## Why Fabric?

|     | Capability | What it unlocks |
| :-: | ---------- | --------------- |
| ⚡ | **Code mode** | One flat tool schema; branching, loops, fan-out, and data flow live in checked TypeScript. |
| 🧰 | **Capability routing** | Call Pi core tools, MCP servers, captured extension tools, or Fabric providers through one runtime. |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 | **Agent runtime** | One-shot workers, durable resident agents, persistent event-driven actors, councils, and bounded recursive queries. |
| 🕸️ | **Workflows + mesh** | Phased progress plus durable topics, shared tasks, and compare-and-swap state. |
| 🛡️ | **Guardrails** | Approvals, isolation, timeouts, concurrency, recursion depth, and shared cost budgets. |
| 🎛️ | **Native TUI** | Live activity, an interactive dashboard, and settings without leaving Pi. |

## How it works

1. **You ask** in plain language, as usual.
2. **Pi writes one program** that calls the tools, agents, and MCP servers it needs. The program is type-checked before it runs.
3. **Only the result returns** to your conversation. Intermediate work stays in the sandbox and surfaces in the activity panel and dashboard.

Under the hood, the model writes something like this — you don't:

```ts
const [manifest, sources] = await Promise.all([
  pi.read({ path: "package.json" }),
  pi.find({ pattern: "**/*.ts", path: "src" }),
]);
return {
  package: JSON.parse(manifest).name,
  sourceCount: sources.split("\n").filter(Boolean).length,
};
```

Independent calls run in parallel; only the returned object enters the model context. Known providers use concise direct calls such as `mcp.fal_ai.get_model_schema(...)`, `memory.recall(...)`, `state.get()`, `schema.status()`, and `compact.status()`; `tools.call({ ref, args })` remains the fallback for refs discovered or computed at runtime.

## Install

Requires Node.js 24+ and Pi 0.80.6+. Fabric also checks a detectable Pi host version at startup and warns when an older host may ignore continuation APIs such as actor `triggerTurn`.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-fabric
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

From GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/monotykamary/pi-fabric
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-fabric
```

For one development run:

```bash
pi -e /absolute/path/to/pi-fabric
```

</details>

## What you can ask for

Advanced patterns are user-invoked and are not advertised for automatic selection. Run `/skill:fabric-guide` when you want one recommendation, or invoke the exact `/skill:<name>` yourself. Describing an ordinary coding task keeps Pi on the core `fabric-exec` path.

| You want | Run |
| -------- | --- |
| Help choosing the smallest advanced mechanism | `/skill:fabric-guide Choose a mechanism to audit every auth file and verify the findings.` |
| Parallel audits, migrations, or research with verification | `/skill:fabric-workflow Audit every auth file and synthesize verified findings.` |
| Work too big for one context window | `/skill:fabric-rlm Produce a compact architecture map of this repo.` |
| A persistent watcher for one measurable goal | `/skill:fabric-supervisor Watch this migration until it is complete and tested.` |
| A strict auditor for one feature design spec | `/skill:fabric-spec Implement docs/specs/checkout.md to the tee; nothing missing, nothing extra.` |
| A quiet decision-point reviewer | `/skill:fabric-advisor Focus on migration correctness.` |
| Same-model independent reviewers and one decision | `/skill:fabric-council Review this design for correctness, security, and operability.` |
| Multi-model compare-not-merge deliberation or act mode | `/skill:fabric-fusion Deliberate this design across models.` |
| One command that infers advisor versus supervisor | `/skill:fabric-ambient advisor Focus on migration correctness.` |
| A durable team coordinating through versioned tasks | `/skill:fabric-swarm Coordinate this migration across owned task partitions.` |
| Evidence-gated edits with postconditions | `/skill:fabric-schema Make this parser change only if focused tests stay green.` |

The foundation is the `fabric-exec` reference skill: the model loads it before its first `fabric_exec` call and again when a call errors on argument shape.

## The dashboard

Fabric adds a live activity surface to Pi, no extra extension required:

- A compact widget above the chat (like `pi-supervisor`) whose header follows the current phase while its rows show active/completed agents, active actors, and their recent nested tool or code-change activity.
- `/fabric` (or `/fabric dashboard`) — **Activity** and **Topology** views where the user-facing Pi session is always present as **Main**. Queue/steer Main, active children, actors, and observed mesh agents; navigate a spring-followed unified topology of runs and project mesh, with paged transcripts, topics, state, and routes.
- `/fabric settings` — mirrors Pi's `/settings` and writes changes to `fabric.json`.
- `/fabric display full|compact` — switches the `fabric_exec` transcript between the default full source view and compact intent-and-tools view.

See the [interface & commands reference](docs/interface.md) for every view, keybinding, and slash command.

- [Interface & commands](docs/interface.md) — dashboard, settings, keybindings, slash commands, and headless runs.
- [Agents, actors & mesh](docs/agents.md) — agents, trajectory-preserving model handoff and `/fabric prewalk`, the Claude and Veda runners, transports, steering, persistent actors, global templates, councils, recursive queries, and durable coordination.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The test suite covers configuration, schema validation, provider dispatch, registered-tool interception and execution, QuickJS isolation, Pi built-in invocation, agents, fake Claude stream-JSON and model discovery, fake Veda JSON runs, workflows, durable mesh state, actor mailboxes and subscriptions, and Pi/Claude actor restoration. Claude and Veda fixtures never make a billable request.
